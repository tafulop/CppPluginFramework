# CppPluginFramework

This is a simle example project made in Visual Studio to demonstrate the shared libarary capabilites of the OS. The program was made for a quick demonstration for my friend, so expect nothing sophisticated here.

If you would like to do a framework application, I highly recommend you to take a look on Boost::DLL library.

Good luck! :)
